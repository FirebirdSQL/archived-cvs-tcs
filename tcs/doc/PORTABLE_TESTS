Purpose :  Portable test writing in TCS--things to avoid
========================================================

Filenames:

Use 8.3 format filenames, eg:
   foo.gbk   Not foo.gbak

Avoid the use of filenames containing other than [A-Za-z0-9_]
(MPE/XL doesn't like <underbar> _)

Avoid the use of filenames that need to be distiguised by
case.  eg: ABC.TXT and abc.txt are the same file on some
platforms.

Avoid the use of filenames that are the same as OS commands.  If
the TCS boiler-plate does not have the current directory first in
the path, the OS will attempt to execute the OS executable and your
test will get bogus errors.

Stderr/Stdout:

Use the "-m" switch on ISQL tests that expect to report errors.
NT will merge stderr and stdout, other platforms will not unless
"-m" is used.

When using
   isc_print_status()
Put a fflush(stdout) after the call, if needed.

Avoid tests that display the following:

- Process ID
- Transaction ID
- CPU time used
- Machine name
- File pathnames
- Database page count

Modularize tests that display the following:

- current Time or Date information

Initializing tests:

Assume WHERE_GDB is set to "./" for local tests.

Assume tests are run initially as user "tester". (eg: not SYSDBA).
Change user when needed for a specific test.
