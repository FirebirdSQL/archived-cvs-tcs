                          VECTORED TCS RUN METHOD
                          -----------------------

1..Tables and general method

   The WORKLIST table in the "ltcs.gdb" database along with new TCS
   logic is used to control the vectored run.  Some columns in this
   table are updated each time a series is run.  Other columns are used
   to control the vectored run and feed information to the scripts which
   execute a given series.

   Scripts controlling the vectored run expect to read a row from
   the WORKLIST table to determine the next series to be run.  The
   selection of a series name from the WORKLIST table is controlled
   primarily by two columns in the WORKLIST table:  STATUS and 
   CONFIGURATION.  

   The STATUS field indicates the current state of the series being run.
   If the status field is zero, then the series needs to be run.  A
   status of 1 indicates that the series run is in progress and a status
   of 2 indicates that the series run is complete.  As the Vectored test
   run executes, the status field is updated to indicate a state change.
   This prevents a series from being run while a current run in in
   progress or from being run more than once.  In some cases, the value
   of the STATUS field prevents the series from being run at all.

   The CONFIGURATION field is used as a parameter to the new TCS
   command "vector."  The script that executes the vectored run sets
   the environment variables, the TCS environment, boiler plate and
   run name and then executes "vector <param>."  The parameter controls
   which WORKLIST rows (Series names) will be selected for execution.

   Other fields in the WORKLIST table support either the run or the
   results of the vectored run.  A boiler plate name is stored for each
   series listed and this boiler plate is used when the series is run.
   To aid in failure analysis the following information is stored in
   WORKLIST:  the name of the machine on which the series was run, the
   start and end times for the series and the number of failures and
   known failures for that series.

   Example WORKLIST data:
   A typical set of rows in the worklist table show the following
   configurations.  A configuration "QA" will be added to run a subset
   of the series listed in WORKLIST.

    (static)           (dynamic) (static)
   SERIES_NAME          STATUS CONFIGURATION        ( meaning )
   ===================  ====== ============= 
   V4_LOCK_GDML              2 SHR           Series Run complete, ran SHR env 
   C_GPRE_SQL                2 RMT           Series Run complete, ran REMOTE

2..Results produced and know failures
   As the vectored run executes raw counts are kept for the following
   test conditions:  pass, fail, known failures, uninitialized tests,
   tests not run.  The pass/fail count does not include the count for
   known failures, uninitialized tests and tests not run.  The results
   of each series is committed after the series completes. 

   A table exists called KNOWN_FAILURES.  As the vectored run executes,
   if a failure occurs and the failure has been previously marked as a
   known failure (MKF command), then the run name for this specific
   failed test is changed.  This prevents the test from appearing as a
   true failure when the "list failures" TCS command is used.
   
   A list of known failures is maintained and used for future runs  [by
   updating the known failures table]  If a test fails and the failure
   is investigated and found to me a minor difference which cannot be
   prevented and will always fail, then the MKS (mark known failures)
   TCS command should be used to group this test into a 'known-failures'
   catagory.  

3..Special tests used by the vectored vun procedure.
   AUDIT_START and AUDIT_FINISH are used before and after a series
   is run.  AUDIT_START cleans up any database files in the test
   directory, and AUDIT_FINISH creates a list of files that are not
   cleaned up by the tests in the series.  This list may be checked
   and used to create a cleanup test for the series.

   tcs> pf audit_finish
   Test AUDIT_FINISH failed on 28-FEB-1995:
   -------------------
   Checking './' directory...
   ./meta.log
   ./tcs.script
   ./tcs.output
   ./ddl1.sql
   ./v3create.qli
   ./cmts

4..Example
   To check the results of a vectored run the following is necessary:

   1.  Connect to the local test database, eg:

       isql hostfoo:/home/tests/li_ltcs.gdb

       and view the data in the WORKLIST table using a query similar
       to the one shown below.

       select SERIES_NAME, MACHINE, STATUS from WORKLIST 
              where CONFIGURATION = "QA"

   2.  Connect to the machine on which the series was run;
       set the run name (<Platform>.<Series name >);
       list the failures:  

       Generic:
       tcs -d machine_name:/home/tests/ltcs.gdb
       srn LI.series name
       lf

       Specific example:
       tcs -d hostfoo:/home/tests/li_ltcs.gdb
       srn LI.IBUGS
       lf
