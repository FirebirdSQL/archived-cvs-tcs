Title: Outline of steps required to configure and run tests (single tests,
       series or metaseries) using TCS with input file tcsrun.input 
      
1. Read TCS_CFG_ON_WINDOWS.txt file to understand about how to configure
   a windows system to run TCS

2. Copy all the files in this directory to your test directory.
   For eg: d:/testbed

3. Run setup_config in your local client testbed directory.
   You will be prompted to enter the name of your server machine,
   server machine OS, server machine testbed directory and protocol
   you wish to use in your test configuration.  

4. Exit current shell.

5. Open a new shell (so new /testbed/profile.ksh variables can take
   effect).

6. Run tcsexpand if your current configuration uses a server machine
   different from the server machine used in the previous configuration.

7. Uncomment (or edit) the metaseries, series, or tests that you wish 
   to run in tcsrun.input.  Remember to separate all non-metaseries groups
   of tests and/or series with a terminal '*'. You may designate a name 
   for a non-metaseries group of tests on the '*' line.  See first example 
   below.  Remember also to check the TCS environment and boilerplate   
   settings, svr version, and isql and gpre dialects if needed.
   
   ***See NOTE below

8. Copy tcsrun.input to /testbed/keep

9. Run chk_env.ksh to review your configuration setup.

***NOTE tcsrun.input examples:

   Example:  rms QA_V60_KIT1  or  r iexample_02   or  r iexample_02
             r iexample_02        r iexample_03       r iexample_03
             r iexample_03        *                   *    
             * partial_series     rms QA_V60_KIT1     rms QA_V60_KIT1
             quit                 quit                rms QA_V60_LANG
                                                      rs QA_V55_PERM_GBAK
                                                      *
                                                      quit
                                                  
   Example: rms QA_V60_KIT1
            rms QA_V60_LANG
            rms QA_V4NOMU_KIT1
            quit

10. If you just want to run a single test using TCS, use the script tcs_go.ksh
