These files are meant as a first step to export and import
test data in plain ascii format to and from the test
database.

This would make it possible to place a test pool under 
cvs control.

To use this stuff:

1. Install IBPerl-0.8p3 (from www.karwin.com).
2. Create a directory named import under your TCS directory. 
3. Copy dump_gtcs.pl, fix_it.sql, import_all, import_gtcs.pl
   to your TCS directory.
   Copy  gtcs.gdl into the import directory.
3. To export data from an existing gtcs.gdb:
   run isql ./tests/gtcs.gdb -i fix_it.sql
   run dump_gtcs.pl
4. to create a new gtcs.gdb from the exported data:
   run gdef -r ./import/gtcs.gdl
   run import_all

5. If you like your newly created gtcs.gdb, copy it to
   your tests directory. 
 
   Sorry, at the moment the TCS will not work correctly 
   with this new gtcs.gdb. I'm working on this.
