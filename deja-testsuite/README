This is the dejagnu test suite trial area, and it still is evolving at 
this stage.

First you need to extract the TCS tests into flat files using Franks
utility in ../extractScript

Then you need to run

./extractTCS.exp  

in this directory.  This will extract all the TCS test cases into testcases/tcs.test/data
Then 

make 

to run them

Have a look at testsuite/tcs.test/tcs.exp to see what actually happens and 
how to simulate the tcs suite.

Or at testsuite/isql.test/limit/isql_limit.exp to see a simple example

And as I said it's all still experimental.

Cheers

To run tests

$make

or

$runtest

or to run an individual test


$runtest testsuite/isql.test/isql_sample.exp


Existing TCS layout

Data is stored in two levels, looks in <platform> database then <global> database for answers.
When expanded they come out as 
export/<platform>  - Where platform is win32/linux/darwin/solaris
export/global

In the flat file formats

Global files 

TESTS.csv    - pointers to test scripts
INIT.csv     - pointers to init scripts



Platform Files

BOILER_PLATE.csv     - script to put at the front of every file sets up a few env
                       variables
ENV.csv              - points to PROLOG files which contain pattern substitutions
                       for parsing the script files.


Platform can also override TESTS and INIT, (but in practive it doesn't happen much)
and global contains ENV and BOILER_PLATE but they are empty.




So to convert need to build testsuite/data/<platform>
script_prologue.sh needs to come from <platform>/*BOILER_PLATE*
and script_subst.txt needs to come from a <platform>/*PROLOG*

Usually the QA_BP is a good template.
